      Step 1. Loading and preprocessing the data

Load the data (i.e. read.csv()) Process/transform the data (if
necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

|Data <- read.csv(file="/users/jb_rough/rwork/activity.csv", header=TRUE)
Data$date <- as.Date(Data$date)
Data$fac <- cut(Data$date, breaks="day")|

Next we can check the data structure and see if the data is adequate for
analysis

|str(Data)|

|## 'data.frame':    17568 obs. of  4 variables:
##  $ steps   : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
##  $ date    : Date, format: "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" ...
##  $ interval: int  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 ...
##  $ fac     : Factor w/ 61 levels "2012-10-01","2012-10-02",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...|

|summary(Data)|

|##      steps             date               interval              fac       
##  Min.   :  0.00   Min.   :2012-10-01   Min.   :   0.0   2012-10-01:  288  
##  1st Qu.:  0.00   1st Qu.:2012-10-16   1st Qu.: 588.8   2012-10-02:  288  
##  Median :  0.00   Median :2012-10-31   Median :1177.5   2012-10-03:  288  
##  Mean   : 37.38   Mean   :2012-10-31   Mean   :1177.5   2012-10-04:  288  
##  3rd Qu.: 12.00   3rd Qu.:2012-11-15   3rd Qu.:1766.2   2012-10-05:  288  
##  Max.   :806.00   Max.   :2012-11-30   Max.   :2355.0   2012-10-06:  288

      2. What is mean total number of steps taken per day? (ignore the
      missing values in the dataset)

Calculate the total number of steps taken per day Make a histogram of
the total number of steps taken each day Calculate and report the mean
and median of the total number of steps taken per day

|stepsPerDay <- tapply(Data$steps, Data$fac, sum)
hist(stepsPerDay)|

|aggregateData <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = Data, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
stepsPerDayMean <- mean(aggregateData$steps)
stepsPerDayMedian <- median(aggregateData$steps)
stepsPerDayMean|

|## [1] 10766.19|

|stepsPerDayMedian|

|## [1] 10765|


      3. What is the average daily activity pattern?

Make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval and the average number
of steps taken,averaged across all days (y-axis) Which 5-minute
interval, on average across all the days in the dataset,contains the
maximum number of steps?

|stepsPerInterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = Data, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
stepsPerInterval[which.max(stepsPerInterval$steps), ]$interval|

|## [1] 835|

|plot(steps~interval, data=stepsPerInterval, type="l")
points(835, 205, pch=4, col=4)|


      4. Imputing missing values

Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset
(i.e. the total number of rows with NAs) Devise a strategy for filling
in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need
to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that
day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

|missingSteps <- sum(is.na(Data$steps))
missingSteps|

|## [1] 2304|

|filledData <- Data
for (i in 1:nrow(filledData)){
        if (is.na(filledData$steps[i])){
                intervalValue <- filledData$interval[i]
                identifier <- which(stepsPerInterval$interval == intervalValue)
                steps <- stepsPerInterval$steps[identifier]
                filledData$steps[i] <- steps
        }
}
print("Check to see if the NAs have been replaced, as all 6 of the header step values were NA")|

|## [1] "Check to see if the NAs have been replaced, as all 6 of the header step values were NA"|

|head(filledData)|

|##       steps       date interval        fac
## 1 1.7169811 2012-10-01        0 2012-10-01
## 2 0.3396226 2012-10-01        5 2012-10-01
## 3 0.1320755 2012-10-01       10 2012-10-01
## 4 0.1509434 2012-10-01       15 2012-10-01
## 5 0.0754717 2012-10-01       20 2012-10-01
## 6 2.0943396 2012-10-01       25 2012-10-01|


      5. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but
      with the missing data filled in.

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day Calculate
and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do
these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the
assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates
of the total daily number of steps?

|stepsPerDayFill <- tapply(filledData$steps, Data$fac, sum)
hist(stepsPerDayFill)|

|aggregateDataFill <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = filledData, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
stepsPerDayMeanFill <- mean(aggregateDataFill$steps)
stepsPerDayMedianFill <- median(aggregateDataFill$steps)
stepsPerDayMeanFill|

|## [1] 10766.19|

|stepsPerDayMedianFill|

|## [1] 10766.19|

|print("the difference in Mean steps per day with NAs imputed is:")|

|## [1] "the difference in Mean steps per day with NAs imputed is:"|

|stepsPerDayMeanFill-stepsPerDayMean|

|## [1] 0|

|print("the difference in Median steps per day with NAs imputed is:")|

|## [1] "the difference in Median steps per day with NAs imputed is:"|

|stepsPerDayMedianFill-stepsPerDayMedian|

|## [1] 1.188679|

|print("The distribution and mean steps per day are unchanged by imputing NAs, but the total")|

|## [1] "The distribution and mean steps per day are unchanged by imputing NAs, but the total"|

|print("number of steps has increased and the median is also affected.")|

|## [1] "number of steps has increased and the median is also affected."|


      6. Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and
      weekends?

For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the
dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part. Create a new
factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend”
Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = “l”) of the
5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken,
averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the
README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot
should look like using simulated data.

|filledData$Day <- weekdays(filledData$date)
for (i in 1:nrow(filledData)){
        if (filledData$Day[i] == "Saturday" | filledData$Day[i] == "Sunday"){
                filledData$Day[i] = "weekend"
        }
        else{
                filledData$Day[i] = "weekday" 
        }
}
filledData$Day <- as.factor(filledData$Day)
stepsPerIntervalFilled <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + Day, data = filledData, mean)
library(lattice)
xyplot(steps ~ interval | Day, stepsPerIntervalFilled, type = "l", layout = c(1, 2), xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Steps")|
